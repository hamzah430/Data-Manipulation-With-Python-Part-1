# Data-Manipulation-With-Python-Part-1
Manipulating data here is not manipulating data, not making data inconsistent with its original value. But Data Manipulation is here to make data easier when analyzed by machines.
## Object Series
The object series has one dimension. It doesn't have a column name because it only has one column. And has an index.
## loc and iloc
With loc and iloc you can do practically any data selection operation on DataFrames you can think of. loc is label-based, which means that you have to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels. iloc is integer index based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer index.
## Data Frame
Pandas DataFrame is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns. Pandas DataFrame consists of three principal components, the data, rows, and columns.
